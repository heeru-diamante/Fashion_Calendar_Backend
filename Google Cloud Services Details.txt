Google Cloud Services Information:

This project leverages Google Cloud services to manage and host various aspects of the application, including storage, hosting, and external API integrations.

1. Google Cloud Storage:
- Bucket Name: cohesive-vine-437901-v1.appspot.com
- Purpose:
     This bucket is used to store uploaded images and their corresponding metadata.
     Utility matrices for each user are also stored as JSON files within this bucket.
- Files Stored:
- Images: Uploaded via the API and stored in paths such as: gs://<bucket_name>/user_<user_id>/<image_name>.
- Metadata JSON: Stored in paths like: gs://<bucket_name>/user_<user_id>_metadata/<image_name>.json.
- Utility Matrix JSON: Stored in paths like: gs://<bucket_name>/user_<user_id>_utility/utility_matrix.json.
- Service Account:
     A service account with the necessary permissions is used to access the Cloud Storage bucket.


2. Google App Engine:
- Purpose: Hosts the Flask API (app2.py), which handles image uploads, metadata processing, and recommendation generation.
- App Configuration:
     The app.yaml file is used to configure the App Engine deployment.
     The application runs in a flexible environment to allow dynamic scaling based on incoming traffic.


3. Authentication:
- Service Account:
    A service account JSON file (service_account_key.json) is used to authenticate the app's interactions with Google Cloud services.
- Permissions:
    The service account has the following roles:
         App Engine Admin
         Storage Admin
         Cloud API Admin

4. APIs Accessed:
- The application interacts with several external APIs to perform image classification and generate personalized recommendations:

    Metadata Classification API: https://bewajafarwah--hf-stackup-image-classifier-fastapi-app.modal.run/metadata
    Local Matrix API: https://abhi995-generatelocalmatrix.hf.space/gradio_api/call/predict
    Recommendation API: https://abhi995-getrecommendation.hf.space/gradio_api/call/predict


5. Dependencies:
- The requirements.txt file lists all the Python dependencies required for this project. Ensure these dependencies are installed when deploying the application to App Engine.
